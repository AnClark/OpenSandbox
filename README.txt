* 2) How to compile
*********************************************************************************************

OpenSandbox have only been build with VS2010 sp1 and .NET 3.5
The reason we use .NET 3.5 is because we don't need any of the new features and
we want to support WinXP and Win7 which is still the biggest versions out there.

*********************************************************************************************
* 3) Prerequisites
*********************************************************************************************

To be able to run your application inside the OpenSandbox you need a reghive file with 
registry settings for the application.
